# About Dataset
Hello And Welcome. In Todayâ€™s Presentation, I Am Excited To Take You Through This Netflix Dataset. This dataset has information about or contains data of movies found on Netflix that people have voted for as the best of all time as at the period.
I Am Really Excited To Be Doing This Presentation As It Has Given Me The Opportunity To Dive Into, And Gain Insightful Information About This Special Project Including But Not Limited To Movies by movie types, best movie for the period, top movies for the period,  total number of movies per country for the period according to Netflix etc

# Processes
I am excited to state that, I took the necessary process in ensuring that this project has passed through the necessary steps and procedure before finally arriving at the final result.
1. Firstly, I got this dataset from Kaggle and downloaded it.
2. Secondly, I extracted the file and named it Netflix dataset analysis on my computer
3. I then loaded the dataset into power bi to perform some data transformation.
4. At this point, I needed to look at my columns for duplicates, outliers and errors.
5. After carefully removing duplicates, outliers and errors, I then proceeded to loading my data to start making sense out of the dataset by creating visuals.
